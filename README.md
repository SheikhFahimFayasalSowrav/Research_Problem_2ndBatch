# Research_Problem_2ndBatch
Data Science with Python: Beginner to Advance
## Hello Researchers, 
Data Science with Python: Beginner to Advance course has prepared two research interest groups. 
1. Group 01
2. Group 02
***
You are almost about to end this course with some successful learnings. 
Now, it's time to step forward and practice if we can solve some research problems of our own. 
***Read the following instructions carefully and solve your problem with python programming.*** A good sample of the report submission is added to your google classroom from the previous batch. 
***

## 1. **Group 1:**

***Problem:*** From 2015 to 2100, CMIP6 RF, Tmax, Tmin data are given in a daily basis. Create **time series plot** of those daily data. Then **covert** the data to **average monthly data** and create the same plot. Then **convert the data set to yearly** and check if there is any **linear regression relationsip** between RF and Tmax or Tmin. Show the results and interpret them. From a **scatter and line plot** find if there is any unusual event or not. submit it as a report with codes.

***More Instructions:***
1. You can make your own flowchart. 
2. You can create new data column from your existing columns.  
3. You can consider the provided flowchart for example.
4. Use Functions and Modules so that the code can be reusable. Do not hard code (hard codes are one that is only works for your problem not others similar problems)
5. Use necessary x-label and y-labels, colors, titles, other labels and texts or informations to your charts.
6. Data set is given with name "Group_1"


## 2. **Group 2:**

***Problem:*** You are given a small data set of some water quality parameters as a .csv file. You have to **add a column named "Turbidity"** which will be **calculated by your program** with the formula from tranperancy/ Secchi Depth to Turidity in FTU or NTU unit. You need to **plot each column** with **bar** charts, **pie** charts, **line** plot, and others **charts** as your wish, and create a table with **descriptive statistical** data. Please add some interpretation to each output and submit it as a report with codes.
